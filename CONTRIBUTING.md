# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Guidelines

Welcome and thank you for contributing to this project.

This file documents the project's contribution standards and important preferences contributors and assistants should follow.

## Communication and Language

- All assistant-generated responses and user-facing messages in this repository MUST be provided in Korean (한국어).
- The assistant should follow the __en-US__ locale for formatting conventions except when the user explicitly requests another locale; however the response language must be Korean.

## Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the project's .editorconfig rules located at the repository root.
- Keep code changes minimal, well-documented, and consistent with existing style.

## Tests

- Add or update unit tests when behavior changes.

## Workflow

- Create branches for feature changes and open pull requests against `main`.
- Ensure all tests pass locally before opening a PR.

## Assistant-specific Requirements

- The assistant (GitHub Copilot) should always respond in Korean to user requests and follow the repository coding and formatting rules.
- When asked for code changes, produce copy-pasteable files that adhere to the project's .editorconfig and existing code style.
